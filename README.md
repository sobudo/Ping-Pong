For numbers divisible by 3 the output is ping
For numbers divisible by 5 the output is pong

## Specifications
The program should count to the number provided by the user for example:

Output : [1, 2, ping, 4, pong, ping, 7, 8, ping, pong, 11]
The program should replace numbers divisible by 3 with ping and those by 5 with pong

Output : [ 1, 2, ping, 4, pong, ping, 7, 8, ping, pong, 11, ping, 13, 14, pingpong]
